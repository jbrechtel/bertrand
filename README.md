This is an implementation of a popular card game in Purescript and Halogen.

This is really for my own sanity so that I can practice the game from my Android phone. There's no longer an Android version of this game available. :(

This uses Purescript 0.12.0 and Halogen 3.1.3

I am explicitly *not* distributing the original graphics with this, though I may generate some at one point.
